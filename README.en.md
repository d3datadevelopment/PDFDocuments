PDF document generator for OXID eShop

Create a wide variety of static or dynamic PDF documents at the touch of a button. The document content is created from templates (Smarty or Twig).

At the orders of your OXID shop you have the option of creating an invoice and delivery note.

The module can be easily extended to adapt existing documents or add new ones. Even completely different document types (e.g. article data sheets or pick lists) are possible.

## System requirements:

- installed OXID eShop version 7.x
- PHP version for which installation packages are available (PHP 8)
- Installation via Composer

## Compatibility:

The module contains the same functionality as the former 'OXID Invoice PDF' module.

## Installation:

```bash
composer require d3/pdfdocuments:^2.0 --update-no-dev
```

Detailed installation instructions can be found [online](https://docs.oxidmodule.com/PDF-Dokumente/) and in the docs directory of this package. The module manual is also available there.
